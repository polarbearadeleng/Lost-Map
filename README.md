##### Lost-Map

##### The first line of input will contain the integer n between 2 and 2500, the number of villages in this region. The next n lines will contain n integers each. The jth integer of the ith line is the distance from village i to village j. All distances are greater than zero unless i = j, less than 10^7, and it is guaranteed that the distance from village i to village j is the same as the distance from village j to village i.

##### For each test case, output n - 1 lines with two integers u and v on each line, indicating that there is a road connecting villages u and v in this region. Assume the villages are numbered from 1 to n. Any solution that outputs the original set of roads will be accepted.
